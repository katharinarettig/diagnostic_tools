<p>
Data, cause-effect relationships and calculations on which the diagnostic tools are based were compiled and described in the (interim) reports on the research projects 
"Determination of factors relevant to measures in the context of stream assessment according to the WFD using the biological quality component macrozoobenthos" and 
"â€˜Development of diagnostic tools for the identification of causal stressors on basis of macroinvertebrates in the context of stream assessment under the WFD". 
Both project were funded by the State Agency for the Environment of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg (LUBW), Germany 
</p>

<p>
The principle of diagnosis was also described in detail in a
<a href="http://mars-project.eu/files/download/final_report/MARS_FinalReport_April2018.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >research report</a>
on the EU project 
<a href="http://mars-project.eu/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&quot;MARS&quot;</a>
(Managing Aquatic ecosystems and water resources under multiple stress).
</p>

<p>
Further diagnostic tools were developed for sand-dominated lowland rivers (LAWA stream type 15, based on macrozoobenthos) and lowland streams (LAWA stream type 20, based on phytoplankton). 
The diagnostic tools as well as a comprehensive information system on the role of multiple stressors and their interactions in water bodies can be accessed through the
<a href="http://freshwaterplatform.eu/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Freshwater Information Platform</a>.
</p>

<p>
The role of multiple aquatic pressures and their interactions has also been summarized in the
<a href="http://mars-project.eu/files/download/recommendations/MARS_Recommendations.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >recommendations</a>
from the MARS project.
