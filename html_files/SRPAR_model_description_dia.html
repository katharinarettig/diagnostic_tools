<h3>
Diagnosis of potential causes of biological degradation of streams and rivers of the pre-alpine region (LAWA stream types 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2) of Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg
</h3>

<p>
The diagnosis is based on the selection of assessment-relevant metrics as well as additionally diagnostic macroinvertebrate metrics. 
An exception is the Trophic Diatom Index (based on diatom assessment) which supports the diagnosis of trophic stress. 
<br> 
Metric values are selected for a water body to be diagnosed in the grayed out area on the left. 
If a metric condition is not known, "Unknown" should be selected.
</p>

<p>
The uncertainty of the diagnosis decreases as the number of selected metric states increases. The diagnosis begins after the first metric state is selected. 
The underlying metric values can be calculated based on macrinvertebrate taxalists (with abundance information) using the 
<a href="https://www.gewaesser-bewertung-berechnung.de/index.php/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >stream assessment tools</a> (in German).

<p>
The result is displayed as an increase in probability of individual stressors in the radar plot on the right. The slider at the end of the 
selection area on the left (scroll down if necessary) can be used to change the scale of the radar plot to increase readability. 
By clicking on the name of a stressor in the radar plot opens, a window with background information on it as well as further explanations, including possible management options, opens.
(Only the headers of the provided information are in English, the text is in German but can be easily copied and pasted in a common translation program.)

<p>
The result is also displayed in tabular form in the tab "Stressor hierarchy".

References to further literature, useful web links, and a link to the manual and tutorial on how to use the diagnostic tools can be found in the tab "Further Information".
