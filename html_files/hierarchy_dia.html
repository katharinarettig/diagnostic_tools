<p>
The hierarchy of potential causes of degradation reflects the presumed hierarchy of effects against the background of the overall selected metrics and their states. 
It is intended to support the diagnosis of causes of degradation but not to tools for ecological status assessment in place or the invaluable knowledge of domain experts. 
</p>
Here, high probability values (>20%) of individual stressors as well as significant differences (>5%) between individual stressors indicate strong cause-effect relationships. 
Low probability values (<10%) for individual stressors as well as small differences (<3%) between individual stressors indicate weak diagnostic results and should therefore be interpreted critically.
</p>
In order to further narrow down the actual causes of degradation, it is recommended to consult data on water quality, morphological and hydrological condition as well as 
land use in the catchment, if available. In particular, the role of the temporal dynamics of the pressures should also be taken into account since extreme pressure situations 
(e.g. temporary oxygen depletion) are often not (or cannot be) recorded as part of routine monitoring.
